greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and
service models ranging from inexpensive fast-food restaurants and cafeterias
to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments.

<pre>A forerunner of the modern restaurant is the thermopolium, an establishment 
in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome that sold and served ready-to-eat food and 
beverages. These establishments were somewhat comparable to modern fast food 
restaurants. They were most often frequented by people who lacked private kitchens.
In the Roman Empire they were popular among residents of insulae.</pre>

<pre>Restaurants are classified or distinguished in many different ways. The 
primary factors are usually the food itself (e.g. vegetarian, seafood, steak); 
the cuisine (e.g. Italian, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, French, Mexican, 
Thai) or the style of offering (e.g. tapas bar, a sushi train, a tastet restaurant,
a buffet restaurant or a yum cha restaurant). Beyond this, restaurants may 
differentiate themselves on factors including speed (see fast food), formality,
 location, cost, service, or novelty themes (such as automated restaurants). Some
 of these include fine dining, casual dining, contemporary casual, family style, 
fast casual, fast food, cafes, buffet, concession stands, food trucks, pop-up 
restaurants, diners, and ghost restaurants.</pre>
